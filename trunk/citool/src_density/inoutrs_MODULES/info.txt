This directory contains different modules for the reading of real-space wave functions and writing down of density.
No filename (i.e. "") for a specific density means that it will not be calculated.
The module also contains the indication of the mp state you are interested in:
WANTBLOCK, WANTRANK   (0, 0 means the ground state).


The specific module needed should be moved in ../ and renamed mod_inoutrs.f90.
==================================================

Now available:

mod_inoutrs_jose.f90
for Jose Movilla single-particle states of nanorods/nanodumbells

mod_inoutrs_hex.f90
for hexagonal domain and grid
